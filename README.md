# Evil Exyrs Discord
 The source code for my Evil Exyrs Discord Bot. This project is mainly for fun.

## Features
Play SpyFall with your friends; Here is how to get started:
   * ```%spyfall game``` - creates a new game of spyfall in your server.
   * Emote 'üïµüèª' to the bot's message to join.
   * ```%spyfall start``` - begins the spyfall game; This will send a private message with the player's role and map.
   * ```%spyfall maps``` - lists the current map collection.
   * ```%spyfall reveal``` - Ends the game and reveals the spy.


**note:** The bot can handle unique games of spyfall from different servers.


Maps are fully customizable, You can add fictional places from your favorite games and shows or add places that you and your friends can relate to.
 * Create a new map: **%spyfall mkmap** <map name\>, <role 1\>, <role 2\>...
    * **Example:** ```%spyfall mkmap Train, Passenger, Cashier, Train Operator, Guard```
 * Remove a map: **%spyfall rmmap** <map name\>
    * **Example:** ```%spyfall rmmap Train```

The bot supports multiple map profiles; You can categorize your collection of places if you want to.
   *  ```%spyfall profile new mapcollection``` - creates a new profile with the "mapcollection" name.
   *  ```%spyfall profile switch mapcollection``` - switches to the new profile.
   *  ```%spyfall profile switch default``` to go back to the original profile.
